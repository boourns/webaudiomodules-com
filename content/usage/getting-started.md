# Getting Started

We would suggest to start by cloning and building the wam-examples GitHub repository, and try the example host (also available online at [https://mainline.i3s.unice.fr/wam2/packages/_/](https://mainline.i3s.unice.fr/wam2/packages/_/)). It contains multiple examples of WAMs developed with different approaches.

Check also the tutorials proposed in the Examples section of this sidebar, as well as the tutorial available at the end of the "Generate WAMs with the Faust IDE" section.
