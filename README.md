This repository contains the www.webaudiomodules.com website, including hosted copies of wam-community and the latest webaudiomodules SDK.

When changes are merged to this repository, Github will automatically deploy whatever content is in `docs/` to www.webaudiomodules.com.

The site is also behind Cloudflare, which acts as a cache, so if you don't see your merged changes live you need to perge the CloudFlare cache.
